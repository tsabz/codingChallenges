Coding challenge can be a very intimidating part interviews, but they shouldn't be!! 
I've put together a document of all my favorite challenges from either LeetCode or codewars, either because they were fun or I just thought they were really helpful. 

## Lets Get Started

### Reverse Integer 
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

```
const reverse = (x) => { return x.toString().split("").reverse().join("")                    

};
```
